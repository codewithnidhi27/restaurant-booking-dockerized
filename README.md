# restaurant-booking-dockerized
This project focuses on the development of a Restaurant Table Booking System and its deployment using Docker to create an efficient, scalable, and platform-independent solution.
The objective of this project is to build a user-friendly table booking system that allows customers to make reservations online, view available tables in real-time, and receive immediate confirmations. Restaurant managers will have access to an intuitive backend interface to oversee upcoming reservations, manage table availability, and avoid overbooking conflicts. By automating and digitalizing the booking process, this system aims to improve operational efficiency, enhance customer satisfaction, and provide better management of restaurant resources.
To ensure seamless deployment and scaling, the system will be dockerized. Docker containers provide isolated and consistent environments for the application, enabling it to run smoothly across various platforms without dependency issues. This approach not only simplifies the deployment process but also ensures that the system is highly portable, scalable, and maintainable. As a result, the restaurant table booking system can be easily replicated, upgraded, or expanded to handle higher demand, ensuring future-proof solutions for both small and large-scale restaurant businesses.
